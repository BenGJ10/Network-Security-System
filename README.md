# Network Security System Project for Phishing Data

This project focuses on building a Network Security System that processes phishing data using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.

## üìå Overview

The system is designed to identify and analyze phishing-related data through structured data workflows. It aims to automate the ingestion and processing of large datasets related to phishing activities for security analysis and detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Pipeline

The core of this system is built around the ETL process:

- **Extract**: Fetches phishing-related data from various sources (e.g., files, APIs, databases).
- **Transform**: Cleans, structures, and enriches the data for meaningful analysis.
- **Load**: Stores the processed data into the desired format or database for downstream use.

This modular pipeline ensures data consistency, scalability, and ease of monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Current Progress

-  Project structure and directories have been set up.
-  Logging system implemented for monitoring pipeline events and tracking.
-  Exception handling mechanisms in place to ensure robust and fault-tolerant processing.

More components will be added in future iterations.
